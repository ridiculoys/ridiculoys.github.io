## Welcome to Louise Gabrielle Talip's page

You can now see Louise's personal information down belo as per requirement in the first exercist of the CMSC 100 Web Programming class section V - 1L.

If you really want to know more about her, you can go to her her [Facebook Account](https://facebook.com/ridiculoys) and stalk her there or message her at lltalip@up.edu.ph

### Name

My name is Louise Gabrielle Talip.

### Nickname

However, most of my close friends call me Loys. As you can probably tell, my name is not only difficult to spell, it is also (apparently) difficult to pronounce without some guidance. My friends have created a fool-proof solution that resulted into this nickname.

### Favorite CMSC subject so far and why

I would like to say firstly that I love all CMSC subejcts equally, just so I don't offend any of the CMSC subjects I have taken. But for the sake of this exer, I would say CMSC 22 is my favorite subject so far. Funny story, we had this similar question during one of my CMSC 130 lab classes, but the opposite was asked - which was my least favorite, in which my answer for that exer is the same as this, but I digress. The reason why is because of how much it taught me not only about the basics of Java, but with the world of Computer Science in general. I had to learn on my own, and create our supposedly "group" project on my own because my groupmates were nowhere to be found. That's when I realized how important cooperation and communication is in this course. You have to stand on the shoulders of giants such as Alan Turing and StackOverflow users in order to understand the mechanics of it, and learn to trust and work hard with your teammates in order to achieve anything great. It was dreadful, yes, but also very fulfilling that I was able to manage it (albeit not perfectly). I, of course, don't want to experience being involuntarily solo ever again, but that subject made me realize a lot of things :)

### Favorite GE so far and why

Ethics 1, for sure. Philosophy has a major link to ComSci in terms of being logical, and understanding concepts that are deemed thought-provoking, which I think is one of the reasons why I resonated so much with it. It was definitely one of the best classes I had during the first sem of my first year.

### Favorite Programming Language and why

I thought it was Python because it's so easy to manage and it was really intuitive, but as of now, I think it would be Java. It has so many applications, it is really flexible in terms of creating algorithms for certain problems and it doesn't need any complicated concepts such as pointers (looking at you C). But seriously, Java has saved us in the programming contest that we joined recently, so I am loving it.

### Favorite food

This is a tough one. It's like trying to think of a favorite song. I'd have to go with ..... adobo.

## Additional Information that has sadly been separated from the Master branch

### Hobbies

These are the things that I enjoy doing - both productive and unproductive.

```markdown
- Programming (I enjoy both competitive and non-competitive programming; Let's go ELIENS!)
- Playing Musical Instruments
- Reading
- Solving puzzles (my friends shun me as I stay in the corner playing with rubik's cubes, sudoku, and minesweeper)
- Biking
- Baking
- Playing Games (ranging from physical games to board games to video games!) 

That's it at the top of my head right now.....

### Childhood Dreams

These are the things that I enjoy doing - both productive and unproductive.

```markdown
I think I had quite a few childhood dreams.

1. Astronaut (yes, that was pretty high on my list. Working with NASA was THE dream)
2. Entertainer (I was into music. Still am, but I don't dedicate a lot of time to it anymore)
3. I honestly thought being a magician was a viable option, but apparently nto according to my conservative family
4. I also thought animation was something I could do, but oh welp

I think those are the only ones I can think off of the top of my head as well, and oh look at the time. It's 6:37pm, I need to submit this exer.
