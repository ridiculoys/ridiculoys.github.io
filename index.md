### Name

My name is Louise Gabrielle Talip.

However, most of my close friends call me ### Loys. As you can probably tell, my name is not only difficult to spell, it is also (apparently) difficult to pronounce without some guidance. My friends have created a fool-proof solution that resulted into this nickname.

These are the things that I enjoy doing - both productive and unproductive.

```markdown
- Programming (I enjoy both competitive and non-competitive programming; Let's go ELIENS!)
- Playing Musical Instruments
- Reading
- Solving puzzles (my friends shun me as I stay in the corner playing with rubik's cubes, sudoku, and minesweeper)
- Biking
- Baking
- Playing Games (ranging from physical games to board games to video games!) 

That's it at the top of my head right now.....
